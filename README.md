# Coral - An Experimental DX First Meta Framework

Coral is an experimental, modern meta-framework designed to make fullstack development as smooth as possible. Featuring routing, server functions, full SPA mode, and an ergonomic React + Wouter setup — Coral focuses on a lightweight yet powerful developer experience.

---

## 🌟 Features

- ⚛️ React + [Wouter](https://github.com/molefrog/wouter) for fast, minimal routing
- 📁 Optional file-based routing system (commented for now)
- 🌐 Built-in **Server Functions** powered by Vinxi
- 🚀 Fully SPA by default with support for HTTP & static routes
- 💡 Zero-config DX — write components, call server logic, ship!

## 🔧 Usage

### Client-Side

```tsx
// src/index.tsx
createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!).render(
  <>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link>
      <Link to="/posts">Posts</Link>
    </nav>

    <Route path="/">
      <h1>Coral - A DX first minimalistic metaframework</h1>
      <Counter />
    </Route>

    <Route path="/posts">
      <PostList />
    </Route>
  </>
);
```

### Server Functions

```ts
// src/getPosts.ts
"use server";

export async function getPosts() {
  const res = await fetch("https://www.learnwithjason.dev/api/v2/episodes");
  if (!res.ok) return { error: true };
  return await res.json();
}
```

### Components

```tsx
// src/components/Counter.tsx
export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>count: {count}</button>;
};
```

```tsx
// src/components/PostList.tsx
export const PostList = () => {
  const [posts, setPosts] = useState([]);
  useEffect(() => {
    getPosts().then(setPosts);
  }, []);
  return (
    <ul>
      {posts.map((post) => (
        <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

## 📡 Vinxi Config

The app uses 3 core routes:

* `spa` → Full client app (`index.html`)
* `http` → API handler (currently in `src/api.ts`)
* `static` → Static assets from `/public`

Server functions are auto-routed via `@vinxi/server-functions`.

---

## 🧪 Try it!

Run the app and visit:

* `/` → Home page with counter
* `/posts` → Server function powered blog list

## Acknowledgements

I want to take a moment to thank the developers and engineering teams whose work, ideas, and content have inspired me throughout this journey:

- **Evan You** – for shaping the modern frontend landscape and showing what thoughtful design in frameworks looks like.  
- **Vite** – for redefining speed and simplicity in tooling.  
- **Vinxi** – for making meta-frameworks fun and surprisingly easy to work with.  
- **Vike** – for being a constant source of inspiration, especially around routing and SSR.  
- **Dev Agarwal** – for breaking down complex concepts in ways that actually stick.  
- **CodeTV** *(formerly Learn with Jason)* – for being that friendly guide into the world of fullstack development and beyond.  
- **Nitro** – for showing how powerful server architecture can still feel lightweight.

And to everyone I may have forgotten — whether you wrote a tool, shared a blog post, answered a question, or just put your ideas out into the world:  
**thank you.** You've made building Coral possible, and the process a lot more joyful.
